Chivey
======

==About==

Are you tired of all those adds and rabbit holes on the chive? Just want to see some hotties? Well this script was generated as a proof of concept that a person does not need to visit the chive site in person, but rather can get a copy of all the photos you wish to see at a blink of an eye. I would also like to mention that I am not a python master, so if you can't execute the code because it is ugly, then thats too bad b/c there are lots of hottie pics on the chive.

==How To==

Feel free to add categories or "custom" file locations to get extra content that is not contained in this script. This script will visit each directory and attempt to download the image to the desigated YYYYMM folder. If the script identifies 10 consecutive 404 messages, it will continue on to the next month, or until all photos you requested were downloaded.
